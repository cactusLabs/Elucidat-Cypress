Example UI Automation project using Cypress. 

Repo is under active development.  

* Cypress will require Node.js installed
* Cypress may be installed from bash via 'npm install cypress --save-dev'
* Cypress runner may be started from the 'Elucidat-Cypress' dir with 'npx cypress open' (headed) or 'npx cypress run' (headless electron)

This example is for demostration purposes only.  It by no means achieves 100% coverage, but provides a good introduction to 
some of the techniques that may be used with Cypress to automate UI testing.
